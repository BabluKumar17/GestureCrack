README

This is a simple script to find the pattern lock code on an Android Device, it was created for a test on Mobile Forensics which was part of my degree.

It works by opening a gesture.key file supplied using the -f flag and comparing it's contents against a Rainbow Table of Gesture Keys created by Soufiane Tahiri http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/android-forensics-cracking-the-pattern-lock-protection/

USAGE

gesturecrack.py -f gesture.key
